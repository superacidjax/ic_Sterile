        Emma Richards
      %h3
        As a college student in Vancouver, Emma was a social butterfly -- she'd never met a person she didn't like. She traveled to Brazil to study art and design thinking that she'd be able to easily make friends. Culture shock along with growing anxiety left her withdrawn and nervous. She needed help.
      %h4
        %strong
          "I never expected to get bitten by the culture shock bug! I have always been a friendly and happy person, but when I arrived in São Paulo, I was a fish out of water. I couldn't make friends because I was so self conscious about not speaking Portugese well enough. I missed my friends and my family (and my cat.) I was so alone! Luckily, I found iCouch. My iCouch therapist has been great. He gives me "homework" to help me make progress each day. Now I'm making friends just as easily as I did back in Canada."
