      %h3
        Dubai, Hong Kong, Istanbul, Paris, Hanoi &mdash; Martin has been all over the world in his job as a naval architect. He loves DJing, dance clubs and vacationing on the beach of Ibiza. However with his fast-paced lifestyle, he found himself with less and less time available for himself or to start a relationship. The anxiety and depression began to grow along with his paycheck. He needed help to find a good work-life balance.

          "With my nearly contant travels, I found that I never could do the things I enjoyed anymore. Even worse, the more I succeeded in my career the worse my personal life options became. I just needed help in managing stress, but also in making a plan to improve my life. With my iCouch therapist, I was able to analyze my priorities and schedule and make some plans to get my old, happy self back again. My weekly appointments are great because even if I'm at the airport or a hotel room, my therapist is as close as my computer."
