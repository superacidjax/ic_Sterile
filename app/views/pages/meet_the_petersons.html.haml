      They're a normal family a lot like yours.

      They smile. They laugh. They travel.

      But behind the smiles, they needed help.

          "When we left for Shanghai, felt like I was uprooted from everything I knew. It wasn't easy to talk to Dan because he  always seemed so distracted. It's hard to be super-mom when you aren't feeling so super. My iCouch therapist really helped me get my spark back."

          "I was incredibly stressed. My job has me going all over the place and when I got home, it felt like I didn't have the energy to be the husband and father my family deserved. My iCouch therapist helped me organize my priorities and find ways to reduce my stress."

          "As soon as I made a new friend, it felt like we had to move away -- again. I didn't want to bother having friends anymore. My iCouch lady helped me figure out that I should be happy that I get to make so many friends in so many different places!"

          "It's hard to explain why I cut myself. It just made me feel better, I guess. My iCouch therapist has been great; she helps me learn to be more relaxed and she understands me. I don't know everything yet, but I'm getting there!"
