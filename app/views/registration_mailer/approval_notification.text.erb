Congratulations <%= @counselor.name %>, you have been approved as an iCouch counselor!

Be sure to set your availability from your Dashboard to ensure potential clients are able
to book appointments with you!

When a client books an appointment, you'll receive an email confirming the appointment
you'll also see the client listed in your upcoming sessions on your dashboard.
Remember, any client that books a session with you
is YOUR client -- treat them exactly as you would a client that might visit your office for
a conventional appointment.

Be sure to keep good records of your sessions -- it's your responsibility to ensure the security
of your patient files.

We highly, highly recommend using a secure, online document service for your Informed Consent or
other documents. We have a special partnership with Right Signature. By signing up for Right Signature
through http://rightsignature.com/p/BD you'll get a $25 credit with them.
They are the absolute best (and legally valid) way to get your documents signed online. It's also very easy for
the client. It's as easy for them as email. We highly discourage fax or email scans for document submissions. The
legality of those documents isn't iron-clad, so protect yourself and do it right. Informed Consent is entirely
your responsibility. As an iCouch Counselor, you're an independent contractor -- in fact, you're our customer. We
support you as best as we can, but ultimately your clients are your clients.

All sessions are 50 minutes, although please budget an hour for each session as this allows some time
in case of technical issues, connection problems or other concerns that show up from time to time.

Sessions are conducted through our integrated video system. When it's time for a session, simply click "Start Session" from your dashboard to enter the video room. It's secure and private. In the event of technical difficulties, don't worry! Email us directly at sessions@icouch.me if you have any problems or questions about the video system.

A client can cancel their session with 48 hours notice to us or you. Within 48 hours of a session, cancellations can be handled as per your individual preference, although we recommend putting the client first and allowing rescheduling within reason. You can still click on "Start Session" for up to three days after a scheduled appointment.

You will be paid every two weeks (or sooner.) It's recommended that you establish a personal (or business) PayPal account -- we can send
your payments much more quickly if you're set up with PayPal. When you sign up with PayPal, please email
us your PayPal username (not the password!) and we'll get you set up to receive payments from us right away.
If you choose not to use PayPal, email us and we'll get your bank information to arrange direct deposits, although
this process can take several days longer than PayPal. There's no need to send us payment information until your first session is booked.

Once again, welcome to iCouch. This is a very new company and we're still perfecting everything, but we're excited
that you have decided to join us.
